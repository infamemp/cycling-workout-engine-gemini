"""
proposal.py — The contract between the Claude reasoning layer and the
deterministic core (spec Section 9).

Claude proposes a workout STRUCTURE via tool-use, returning JSON that matches
PROPOSAL_TOOL_SCHEMA. Python then VALIDATES every proposal against the hard
rules before accepting it. A rejected proposal is discarded and re-requested —
never silently "fixed", never accepted blind.

Division of responsibility (confirmed):
  - Claude decides: main-set structure (reps, durations, recoveries, pattern),
    intensity %s within the requested zone, optional subordinate complementary
    stimuli, HR staircase shape, progression week-to-week shape.
  - Python owns: validation, TSS/IF math, rendering, output gate. Claude never
    does the math and never produces the final syntax directly.
