"""
progression.py — Reasoned multi-session progressions (spec Section 15) under
the free-reasoning / no-KB rule (Section 9.6).

The user asks for e.g. "a Tempo progression." The engine REASONS the whole
sequence of sessions — each progressing (typically in volume, letting power
progress on its own, not driven up), alternating structure, up to the
stimulus's physiological ceiling — and then, when that ceiling is reached,
may note it's time to graduate to the next stimulus. This is reasoned live,
never copied from a cached template.

Claude returns the progression as an ordered list of per-session structural
proposals (same shape as a single-session proposal). Python validates each,
then builds/renders each with the deterministic core.
